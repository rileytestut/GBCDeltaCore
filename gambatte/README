About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gambatte is a portable, open-source Game Boy Color emulator.

The core emulation code is contained in a separate library backend
(libgambatte) written in platform-independent C++. There is currently a Qt GUI
frontend (gambatte_qt), and a simplistic command-line interface SDL frontend
(gambatte_sdl).

The Qt frontend has been ported to Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/BSD/Unix-like
OSes with audio/video engines utilizing native APIs on these platforms.

The SDL frontend should be usable on all platforms with a working SDL port. It
should also be quite trivial to create new (simple) frontends (note that the
library API should in no way be considered stable).

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will have to supply Gambatte with a ROM image file of the GB/GBC
program/game you would like to run/play, either as a command line argument, or
through the File->Open... menu in gambatte_qt.

gambatte_sdl keyboard commands:
TAB    - fast-forward
Ctrl-f - toggle full screen
Ctrl-r - reset
F5     - save state
F6     - previous state slot
F7     - next state slot
F8     - load state
0 to 9 - select state slot 0 to 9

Default key mapping:
Up:     Up
Down:   Down
Left:   Left
Right:  Right
A:      D
B:      C
Start:  Return
Select: Shift

Compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Gambatte from source code can be done by executing the
build_<qt/sdl>.sh scripts for the qt/sdl frontends respectively, or by issueing
the correct build command (either 'scons' or 'qmake && make') in the top-level
subdirectories (libgambatte will have to be built first). The clean.sh script
can be executed to remove all generated files after a compile (including
binaries).

Requirements for building libgambatte:
- A decent C++ compiler (like g++ in the GNU Compiler Collection).
- SCons.
- optionally zlib

Requirements for building gambatte_sdl:
- A decent C++ compiler (like g++ in the GNU Compiler Collection).
- SDL headers and library.
- SCons.
(- libgambatte.)

Requirements for building gambatte_qt:
- A decent C++ compiler (like g++ in the GNU Compiler Collection).
- Qt4 (Core, GUI, OpenGL) headers and library.
- Qmake and make (GNU Make should work).
- Platform-specific requirements:
  * MS Windows:
    - Win32 API headers and libraries.
    - DirectSound and DirectDraw7 headers and libraries.
    - Direct3D9 headers
  * Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes:
    - POSIX/UNIX headers (unistd.h, fcntl.h, sys/ioctl.h, sys/time.h, sys/shm.h).
    - Open Sound System header (sys/soundcard.h).
    - X11 Xlib, XVideo, XRandR and XShm headers and libraries.
    - Alsa headers and library (Linux only).
  * Max OS X:
    - Recent Mac OS X SDK (Panther Xcode/SDK should work)
(- libgambatte.)

Installing after a compile simply amounts to copying the generated binary
(either gambatte_qt/bin/gambatte_qt<.exe> or gambatte_sdl/gambatte_sdl<.exe>)
to wherever you'd like to keep it.
